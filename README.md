# WaterQualityPrediction_AICTE
This project aims to predict multiple water quality parameters using machine learning techniques, specifically MultiOutputRegressor wrapped around a RandomForestRegressor.
# Overview
Access to clean water is a critical global concern. Accurate prediction of various water quality metrics can help in early detection of pollution and ensure timely intervention.

In this project, we:

-Collected and preprocessed real-world water quality datasets.
-Used supervised machine learning for multi-target regression
-Built a pipeline using MultiOutputRegressor with RandomForestRegressor
-Evaluated the model using appropriate regression metrics
